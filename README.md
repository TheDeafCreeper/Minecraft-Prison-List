# Updating The Site

Want to help the site stay up to date? Feel free to add prisons, escapes, builders, and escapists as JSON files in their respective folders (/src/SiteData/Prisons, /src/SiteData/Escapes, /src/SiteData/Builders, and /src/SiteData/Escapists) and any images in /src/SiteData/CATEGORY/Images. The images should be named following the conventions Prison_Name-Image_Name, and the JSON file should be called Prison_Name. Once this is all done, you can create a pull request!
