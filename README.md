# Minecraft Prison List

The goal of Minecraft Prison List is to provide a full list of Minecraft Prisons, their builders, and escapists.

# Submitting A Prison

To submit a prison, create an issue with the following layout:

- Prison Name
- Basic Description
- Creator(s) names (Perferably Discord name and discriminator as well as Minecraft names)
- Minecraft Version(s)
- Prison Version(s)
- Direct download link(s) (no Discord invites to get the download)
- (Optional) Video on the prison.

# Submitting An Escape

To submit an escape, create an issue with the following layout:

- Prison Name/Link to prison
- Discord name(s) and Disciminator(s)
- Minecraft Name
- Video of escape
- Prison Version
- Game Version

# Submitting Builders

To submit a builder to the site, create an issue with the following layout:

- Discord name and Discriminator
- Minecraft name
- List of prisons (That preferably exist on the site)

# Submitting Escapists

To submit an escapist to the site, create an issue with the following layout:

- Discord name and Discriminator
- Minecraft name
- List of escapes (That preferably exist on the site)

# Updating The Site

Want to help the site stay up to date? Feel free to add prisons, escapes, builders, and escapists as JSON files in their respective folders (/src/SiteData/CATEGORY) and any images in /src/SiteData/CATEGORY/Images. The images should be named following the conventions Prison_Name-Image_Name, and the JSON file should be called Prison_Name-Prison_ID (If you dont know what the ID should be use XXXXXX). I'd reccomend using an existing JSON file as reference to make you life easier, but once you're all done, you can create a pull request!
